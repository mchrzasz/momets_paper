Dear Sir or Madam,

our replies to the specific questions and comments follow, in the same
of occurence as in the cover letter.

1.  The full affiliations should read

    * for author Frederik Beaujean:

    C2PAP, Universe Cluster, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität M\"unchen, 85748
    Garching, Germany


    * for author Marcin Chrzaszcz:

    Physik-Institut, Universität Z\"urich, 8057 Z\"urich, Switzerland

    and

    H.~Niewodniczanski Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences,
    31-342 Krakow, Poland


    * for author Nicola Serra:

    Physik-Institut, Universität Z\"urich, 8057 Zürich, Switzerland


    * for author Danny van Dyk:

    Theoretische Physik 1, Naturwissenschaftlich-Technische Fakult\"at,
    Universit\"at Siegen, 57068 Siegen, Germany


2.  We confirm that the second author's name is spelt correctly.


3.  We have verified the correctness of the copyediting changes.
    Please see also our list of further changes at the end of this letter.


4.  Please replace 'FCNC-mediated decay' by

    flavour-changing-neutral-current-mediated decay


5.  We confirm that the two occurrences of 'polymials' should be changed to
    'polynomials'.


6.  We verify that the indents are correct.


7.  In section III.A, third paragraph, please change the first sentence to read as follows:

    For the selected class of decays, which are illustrated in figure 1, we can describe that
    problem as follows:


8.  The funding information is accurate but incomplete, see also point B below.
    Unfortunately, the DOI for the funding agency 'Polish ministry of higher
    education' is not known to us. Please add it to the list of funding
    agencies.


9.  We confirm the change.


10. For reference [1] we can provide a link to the document record on inSPIRE:

    http://inspirehep.net/record/469078

    The full entry for reference [6] reads:

    D. R. Cox and E. J. Snell. A general definition of residuals.
    Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Methodological), 30(2):248-275, 1968.

    It can be accessed, e.g., via

    http://www.jstor.org/stable/2984505


11. We verify the links in the references.


12. We verify the change.


13. See reply to 10.


Beyond the above replies, we would like to make the following minor to the
manuscript:


A. After submission to PRD we found it necessary to make the following changes
   to the text.

   * In the paragraph after eq. (5), after the sentence "Note that a similar
     ...", please append the following text:

      In~\cite[section X]{Chung:1997qd}, the basic ideas and formulae were
      already given but the latter contained a number of typographical errors
      and the presentation was not easy to understand. Compared
      to~\cite{Chung:1997qd}, we fill the gaps needed to apply the method in
      practice and explain in detail its advantages and disadvantages on a
      sound statistical basis.

   * Below eq. (32), the first sentence should read:

      In words, for each $m$ it is required to generate $N_\text{t}^{m)}$
      events from a toy physical distribution $P^{(m)}$, for which $S_0 =
      S_m=1/2$ and all other observables are set to zero.

     The second sentence should read:

      Next, propagate these $N_\text{t}^{(m)}$ events through a detector
      simulation to obtain $N_\text{d}^{(m)}$ accepted events.

     In the third sentence, please move the differentiall \rmdx{\xd} between
     the integral sign and the integrand, for consistency with the rest of the
     manuscript.

   * In eq. (33), please replace both occurrences of 'N_\text{d}' by
     'N_\text{d}^{(m)}'.


B. Please replace the Acknowledgments with the following:

    We thank Ulrik Egede for insightful discussions and helpful comments
    on the manuscript. We are grateful to Gudrun Hiller, Martin Jung, and
    Konstantinos Petridis for helpful discussions, as well as Claus Grupen
    for helpful advice in searching the literature.
    Tobias Schlüter made us aware of existing ideas on our method in~\cite{Chung:1997qd} and
    his thesis~\cite[page 123]{Schlueter:2012}.
    F.B. is grateful for the support by the DFG Cluster of Excellence "Origin and Structure of the
    Universe".
    M.C. has been supported by the ''Diamond Grant'' founded by
    the Polish Ministry of Higher Education.
    N.S. acknowledges the support of the Swiss National Science Foundation,
    PP00P2-144674.
    The work of D.v.D has been supported by the Bundesministerium f\"ur Bildung und Forschung
    (BMBF).
    Part of the numerical simulations have been carried out on
    the computing facilities of the Computational Center for Particle and
    Astrophysics (C2PAP).


Due to the above changes, two additional references appear. Chung:1997qd can be
taken from inSPIRE as is. Schlueter:2012 refers to the following inSPIRE
record:

    http://inspirehep.net/record/1296922



In light of the substantial changes to the manuscript, we ask you to send us the corrected
version before we approve.


Danny van Dyk (for the authors)
