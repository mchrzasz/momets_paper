Dear Sir or Madam,

our replies to the specific questions and comments for the second proof follow.


1. We confirm the updated author group and the affiliations.


2. With the exception of footnote 1 (see below in point 5), all first-proof corrections
have been addressed, and the changes were accurately made.


3. Once footnote one is corrected, the paper will be ready to be published. We do not
require a further proof.


4. We confirm the amendment.


5. The requested change to footnote 1 has not been applied throughout. Please
typeset the 'P' in 'pure P-wave' as well as the 'S -- P' before 'interference'
in an upright font. Also, please add a whitespace between 'D' and 'interference'
in the last sentence.


6. We confirm the change.


7. All funding agencies have been properly identified.


8. We confirm that the text citations refer to the correct renumbered references.


9. The newly added reference appear correctly.



We trust that the remaining changes to footnote 1 will be made accurately, and
do not require a revised proof.


Yours faithfully,
Danny van Dyk (for the authors)
